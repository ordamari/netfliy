# Netfliy

A clone of Netflix using React and Styled-Components. The application is a pixel-perfect replica of the Netflix landing page, login, signup, and browse pages. By utilizing React and Styled-Components, I was able to create a seamless user interface and a responsive design that accurately mimics the original Netflix platform. This project showcases my expertise in building complex web applications using modern front-end technologies and delivering high-quality, visually stunning user interfaces.
